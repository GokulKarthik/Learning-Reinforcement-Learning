# Learning Reinforcement Learning
I want to learn reinforcement learning practically by implementing the RL algorithms using python and experimenting with them

### Note: 
I have discontinued this since my office project got reassigned in Deep Learning. But still RL is a very cool stuff. I hope to update this soon.
